# Warming_Earth_Climate_Patterns_Across_the_Globe
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of global temperature changes over the period 1961 to so far, using historical climate data. By leveraging Python and data visualization libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, the project explores spatial and temporal patterns in temperature anomalies across countries and continents.
